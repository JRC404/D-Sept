# Challenge 1: Character Selection

## Task
* Modify the existing console application to allow the user to input a number, and then display the details of the character corresponding to that number from the Star Wars API.

## Instructions

* After running the application, prompt the user to enter a number (e.g., "Enter a character number: ").
* Take the user's input and convert it to an integer.
* Fetch and display the details (name, height, mass) of the character with the corresponding number from the Star Wars API.
* Handle input validation to ensure the number is within a valid range (1 to the total number of characters available)

# Challenge 2: Character Search

## Task
* Extend the application to allow the user to search for a character by name.

## Instructions

* After running the application, prompt the user to enter a character's name (e.g., "Enter a character name to search: ").
* Take the user's input and search for a character in the list of characters obtained from the Star Wars API.
* If a character with a matching name is found, display their details (name, height, mass).
* If no character matches the name, provide a message indicating that the character was not found.
